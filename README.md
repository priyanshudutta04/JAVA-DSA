## Building from Source

1. Ensure you have [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed on your system.
2. Fetch latest source code from master branch.
```
git clone https://github.com/eDemy-SIH/eDemy-App.git
```
4. Go to the cloned directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
5. You can now run the example scripts or create your own scripts.
